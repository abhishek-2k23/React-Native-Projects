# Rolling Dice Mobile Application

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Rolling Dice  
**Technology:** React Native

## Description

The Rolling Dice mobile application is a simple and fun project developed in React Native. The main functionality of the app is to simulate rolling dice. The app features six dice images and a button that, when clicked, generates a random dice result for the user.

- **6 Dice Images:** The application includes six different dice images, each representing a different possible outcome.
  
- **Roll Button:** A user-friendly button that, when clicked, triggers the dice rolling functionality and displays a random dice result.

## Learning Experience

Throughout the development of this project, I gained insights into handling images in a React Native application. Particularly, I delved into managing image sources with TypeScript and utilizing React Native props with children. This experience enhanced my understanding of working with images in a mobile app environment.
